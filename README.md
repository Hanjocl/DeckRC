# How to install:
1. Go through the submodule installations guides to install all dependecies (see the following READMEs)
    - [ExpressUSB-Controller](https://github.com/Hanjocl/ExpressUSB-Controller)
    - [OpenIPC-QML-Element](https://github.com/Hanjocl/OpenIPC-QML-Element)
    - [SDL-RC-Controller](https://github.com/Hanjocl/SDL-RC-Controller)
  
    - For windows I used VCPKG for most, expect for QML
    - For Linux I just used the platfroms package manager, expect for QML
    - QML was installed through their online installer
