# DeckRC
Another attempt

TO-DO:
- Make Serial port configurable through UI
- Connect Controller input to CRSF channels
- Fix the inputController Class so it can do:
    1. Change configs
    2. auto-load config



    LOR:
    - Needs to be loaded from JSON file
    - Needs to be able to switch seamless from settings to other settings
    - Needs to be able to switch sealess from channel settings to other channel settings
    - Configuration needs to take less than a few minutes
    - Display should show all values the user needs
