# How to install:
1. Go through the submodule installations guides to install all dependecies (see the following READMEs)
    - [ExpressUSB-Controller](https://github.com/Hanjocl/ExpressUSB-Controller) - Establishes communication with a ExpressLRS transmitter
    - [OpenIPC-QML-Element](https://github.com/Hanjocl/OpenIPC-QML-Element) - Establishes a video stream with a RTL8812AU wifi Receiver
    - [SDL-RC-Controller](https://github.com/Hanjocl/SDL-RC-Controller) - Maps keyboard & controller inputs to channels for use with ExpressUSB
   
NOTES:
- For windows I used VCPKG for most, expect for QML
- For Linux I just used the platfroms package manager, expect for QML
- QML was installed through their online installer
